## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.68+ 
- Cargo
- Platform-specific TEE development kits (optional)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rebornbeat/suistack0x/tee.git
cd tee

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test
```

### Hardware Compatibility
Before using SuiStack0X TEE, check your hardware compatibility:

```bash
# Check TEE platforms available on your system
cargo run -- hardware detect

# Get detailed hardware capabilities
cargo run -- hardware capabilities

# Check compatibility with a specific platform
cargo run -- hardware check intel_sgx

### Security Assessment
Evaluate the security of available TEE platforms:

# Get security rating for a platform
cargo run -- rating rate intel_sgx

# Compare security of two platforms
cargo run -- rating compare intel_sgx arm_trustzone

# Get platform recommendations for a use case
cargo run -- rating recommend financial
```

### Security Assessment
Evaluate the security of available TEE platforms:

```bash
# Get security rating for a platform
cargo run -- rating rate intel_sgx

# Compare security of two platforms
cargo run -- rating compare intel_sgx arm_trustzone

# Get platform recommendations for a use case
cargo run -- rating recommend financial
```

### Security Model
The SuiStack0X TEE Framework provides a comprehensive security model that includes:

### Attestation Security

Remote Attestation: Cryptographically verify platform and code integrity
Attestation Chaining: Link multiple attestations for complex workflows
Cross-Platform Verification: Validate attestations across different TEE technologies

### Execution Security

Isolated Execution: Run code in protected memory environments
Side-Channel Protection: Mitigate timing and cache-based attacks
Memory Encryption: Keep sensitive data encrypted in memory

### Data Security

Hardware-Backed Storage: Utilize TEE-specific secure storage
Encrypted Persistence: Securely store data with strong encryption
Memory Protection: Prevent unauthorized memory access

### Key Management

Secure Key Generation: Create keys within the secure environment
Key Derivation: Derive encryption keys from hardware-bound values
Secure Key Storage: Store keys in hardware-protected storage

### Sui Blockchain Integration
SuiStack0X TEE Framework integrates with Sui Blockchain to provide:

### Move Contract Execution

Execute Move smart contracts within secure enclaves
Provide cryptographic proof of execution
Ensure privacy of contract data and state

### On-Chain Attestation

Register TEE attestations on-chain
Create verifiable proofs of computation
Enable decentralized verification of TEE execution

### Privacy-Preserving Transactions

Process sensitive transaction data in TEEs
Generate zero-knowledge proofs for verification
Maintain privacy while ensuring correctness
