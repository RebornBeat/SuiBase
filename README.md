### Compute Module

The Compute Module provides decentralized serverless computing with TEE-based privacy and security.

#### Key Components
- **Function Registry**: On-chain registry for serverless functions
- **Compute Nodes**: Decentralized network of TEE-secured compute providers
- **Execution Protocol**: Verifiable computation with cryptographic proofs
- **Function Permissions**: Fine-grained access control for functions

#### Execution Model
Functions are executed in TEE-secured environments that provide:
- Verifiable Execution: Cryptographic proof that code ran as specified
- Data Privacy: Input and output data remains encrypted
- Integrity Protection: Prevents tampering during execution
- Performance Isolation: Dedicated resources for each execution

#### TEE Protection
The Compute Module leverages TEEs to provide enhanced security:
- Remote Attestation: Verify TEE integrity before execution
- Memory Encryption: Data remains encrypted in memory
- Code Verification: Ensure unmodified function code 
- Secure Key Management: Protected cryptographic operations

### Edge Module

The Edge Module provides a decentralized content delivery network with routing, caching, and security features.

#### Key Components
- **Domain Registry**: On-chain registry connecting SuiNS domains to content
- **Edge Nodes**: Decentralized network of content delivery nodes
- **Routing Protocol**: Intelligent request routing system
- **Caching System**: Optimized content caching strategies

#### Integration with SuiNS and Walrus
The Edge Module seamlessly integrates with:
- **SuiNS** (Sui Name Service): For human-readable domain names
- **Walrus**: For decentralized content storage

This integration works as follows:
1. SuiNS resolves domains to SuiStack0X Edge configurations
2. Edge configurations reference content stored on Walrus 
3. Edge nodes retrieve and serve content from Walrus
4. All operations are verified on-chain

#### DNS Resolution
Since `.sui` domains aren't part of the global DNS system yet, SuiStack0X provides multiple methods for accessing `.sui` domains:

1. **Browser Extension**: The SuiStack0X browser extension intercepts requests to `.sui` domains and routes them through the decentralized edge network
2. **Gateway Service**: Access `.sui` domains through `https://gateway.suistack0x.io/domains/mydapp.sui`
3. **Local DNS Resolver**: Configure local DNS to resolve `.sui` domains through SuiStack0X resolvers
4. **Modified /etc/hosts**: Manually map `.sui` domains to SuiStack0X edge node IPs

#### Caching Strategies
SuiStack0X Edge supports advanced caching strategies:
- Standard Caching: Basic TTL-based caching
- Intelligent Caching: Content-aware caching based on usage patterns
- Geo-Distributed Caching: Location-optimized content distribution  
- Conditional Caching: Cache based on content type and request patterns

#### DDoS Protection
The Edge Module provides robust DDoS protection through:
- Distributed Architecture: No single point of failure
- Rate Limiting: Configurable per-IP and per-region limits
- Traffic Analysis: ML-based anomaly detection
- Challenge-Response: Automatic challenge for suspicious traffic

### Index Module

The Index Module provides high-performance blockchain data indexing with privacy-preserving queries.

#### Key Components
- **Index Registry**: On-chain registry for index configurations 
- **Indexer Nodes**: Decentralized network of indexing providers
- **Query Engine**: Optimized data retrieval system
- **Schema System**: Flexible data modeling for blockchain data

#### Data Sources
SuiStack0X Index supports multiple data sources:
- Sui Blockchain: Events, transactions, and objects
- Cross-Chain: Data from other blockchains via bridges
- Off-Chain: Verifiable off-chain data sources  
- Custom Sources: Developer-defined data sources

#### Query Interfaces
SuiStack0X Index provides multiple query interfaces:

- **GraphQL API**: Flexible querying with GraphQL
- **REST API**: RESTful endpoints for common queries
- **WebSocket Subscriptions**: Real-time updates for indexed data

#### Custom Indexing
Developers can define custom indexing logic:
- Event-based indexing with mappings 
- Aggregation pipelines for complex metrics
- Index-specific query resolution

### Deploy Module

The Deploy Module provides trustless CI/CD pipelines for Web3 applications with verifiable builds.

#### Key Components

- Expose functions via Edge routing configuration

### Compute + Index Integration 

Index data can be processed by Compute functions:
- Subscribe to index updates in Compute functions
- Query indexed data for processing

### Deploy + Edge + Compute Integration

Deploy can update Edge and Compute configurations:  
- Configure pipelines to update multiple services
- Automate deployments across environments

## Security Model

SuiStack0X employs a comprehensive security model:

### TEE Security

All nodes in SuiStack0X are secured by Trusted Execution Environments:
- Code Integrity: Ensures code is unmodified
- Data Confidentiality: Protects sensitive data  
- Execution Isolation: Prevents interference
- Remote Attestation: Verifies TEE authenticity

Supported TEE platforms:

- Privacy-Preserving Queries: Extract insights without exposing raw data
- Confidential Transactions: Private transaction processing

## Economic Model

SuiStack0X operates on a unified economic model with flexible resource allocation:

### Staking Mechanism

Node operators stake SUI tokens to participate in the network, with stake serving as:
- Security deposit against malicious behavior
- Resource commitment indicator
- Reward distribution basis

### Resource Credits

Stake is converted to Resource Credits (RCs) that can be flexibly allocated:
- Compute Credits (CCs)
- Bandwidth Credits (BCs)
- Storage Credits (SCs)
- Build Credits (BCs)

Node operators can adjust their allocation based on hardware capabilities and market demand.
